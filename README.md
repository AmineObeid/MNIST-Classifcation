# MNIST-Classifcation
Basic usage of CNNs, in this repo, I discovered the usage of CNNs by using the MNIST dataset.
This project is a first basic project on a list of long ones I intend to do, aka this serves as my "hello, world".

Note: I copy the architecture of TinyVGG as my CNN used for the classification task.
